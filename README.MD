## Description

This is my personal portfolio, the purpose of this project is to showcase my knowledge about HTML and CSS and to centralize all of my information about me.

It is useful for employers in particular as they can come to my portfolio and have a look for themselves ion where I stand in terms of programming knowledge and what kind of skills I already have.
Gives them a picture of who I am and what I can do in coding. 

While working on this project I learned how to master Bootstrap. how to customize bootstrap CSS how to create numerous pages and kink them to one another.

I also learned how to fork with email forms as well as how to create wire frames and a lot of other useful things.
